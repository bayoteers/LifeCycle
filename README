== Bugzilla Lifecycles Calculator ==

This bit of software helps calculate the lifecycle of a bug or set of bugs. 

The lifecycle is the avg time in days passed for the bug to pass from state A to state B.

There are several kind of lifecycles calculated:

Overall: New --> Closed
Fixing:  New --> Resolved/Fixed
Releasing: Resolved/Fixed --> Released
Verification_fixed: Released/Fixed --> Verified
Verification_unfixed: Resolved/NotFixed --> Verified
Waiting: Waiting --> Resolved

The tool has 3 main routines:

1) Dump the DB content
2) Rebuild the history forward (bugzilla stores it backward)
3) Calculate lifecycles

Since the tool _has_ the history of all the bugs (with flags and keywords and stuff) it can
in theory be used to calculate any kind of statistics.

Also the tool has in the cfg file facilities to filter the bugs by type (severity and/or flags and/or keywords).

== Output ==

The scripts produce 2 kind of outputs: CSV and HTML.

HTML contains also the links to the bugtracking system instance.

CSV is mainly for post-processing.

The files end up in a dir that you need to configure in the cfg file


== Installation ==

Build the debian package and install it. Repackage it if you don't use Debian.
